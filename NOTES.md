# Cryptography Notes

```
Dimensions of a viewing area, along with other key properties, can precisely determine the position of items within a line wrapping dataset. 

Positional location of desired data will be unknown and unpredictable without knowing the correct height x width of all objects

Width = Cypher key = 800px, must be 100% predictable
Font = Type=Cypher key, Weight=Cypher key, px=Cypher key, must be 100% predictable
Padding = "HELLO00000", noted
