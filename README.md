# Security Research
A collection of security related projects I'm working on.



## Op Desert Thorns
Independent Security Research and On-Site Audit

**Goal** 
Improve security and preparedness of the US Military by conducting real-world operations, without prior knowledge, that an exercise is taking place. 

**Status** 
Operation Completed Successfully

**Scope of Audit:**

 - Intelligence Collection and Management
 - Physical Security Controls and Countermeasures
 - Situational Preparedness of Personnel
 - Findings
 - Lessons Learned

## Lessons Learned
 - Automotive grommit found within a vehicles engine bay, usually along the inside edge of the hood, can be used to circumvent security controls such as; barbed wire, razor wire or constantine wire by acting as a mechanical shield.
 - Automotive grommit, or items similar in nature, may allow circumvention of electrified perimeter fencing by acting as an electrical insulator.
